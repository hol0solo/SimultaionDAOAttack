DAO Attack Simulation (2016)
This project is dedicated to simulating the infamous DAO attack that occurred in 2016 on the Ethereum blockchain, highlighting vulnerabilities in smart contracts and the importance of secure coding practices.
The DAO Attack (2016) - Overview
In June 2016, The DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), a decentralized venture capital fund on Ethereum, was exploited due to a reentrancy vulnerability in its smart contract. An attacker drained approximately 3.6 million ETH (valued at $50 million at the time) by recursively calling the withdraw function before the contract could update its balance. This incident led to a hard fork of Ethereum, creating Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC), and underscored the need for rigorous smart contract auditing.
Project Structure
Scripts

scripts/simulate.js: This script simulates the DAO attack by deploying two contracts (TheDAO and Attacker) and executing the attack. Here's what it does:
Deploys TheDAO contract using a deployer account.
Deploys Attacker contract using an attacker account, linking it to TheDAO contract.
Funds TheDAO with 10 ETH from the deployer.
Executes the attack by calling the attack function on the Attacker contract with 1 ETH, exploiting the reentrancy vulnerability.
Logs the final balance of the Attacker contract to show the stolen ETH.



Contracts

contracts/:
TheDAO.sol: A simplified version of The DAO contract, replicating the vulnerable functionality for educational purposes.
Attacker.sol: A contract designed to exploit TheDAO by performing a reentrancy attack.



Configuration Files

package.json: Contains project dependencies and scripts, including the simulate script to run the simulation.
package-lock.json: Locks the dependency versions for reproducibility.

Dependencies

artifacts/ and cache/: These folders are generated by Hardhat during compilation and contain compiled contract artifacts and cached build data.

Setup and Run Instructions
To run the project, follow these steps:

Prerequisites:

Install Node.js and npm.
Add npm to your system PATH (ensure you can run npm in your terminal).


Clone the Repository and Navigate:

Open a command prompt (cmd) and navigate to the project folder:cd path\to\your\project




Install Dependencies:

Run the following command to install the required packages:npm install




Compile the Contracts:

Compile the Solidity contracts using Hardhat:npx hardhat compile




Run the Simulation:

Execute the simulation script to deploy contracts and simulate the attack:npm run simulate





After running the simulation, you will see the deployed contract addresses and the attacker's final balance in the console, demonstrating the success of the reentrancy attack.
